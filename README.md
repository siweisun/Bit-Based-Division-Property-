# Bit-Based-Division-Property-

1. This repository includes the supporting material of the paper entitled 
"MILP-aided bit-based division property for primitives with non-bit-permutation linear layers". 
Please find the paper at https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/811.pdf.

3. These algorithms are implemented by Sun Ling, Key Laboratory of Cryptologic Technology and Information Security, Ministry of Education, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.

4. The repository contains some implementations for the search of integral distinguishers.

5. 'multitest.py' is implemented in Python with the help of Gurobi optimiser. Please find at http://www.gurobi.com/ for more information.
